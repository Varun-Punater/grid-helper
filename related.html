                            This website drew inspiration from another popular trivia site called ImmaculateGrid, known
                            for captivating fans of various sports such as basketball, American football, soccer, and
                            baseball. The idea for this website sprouted from my personal encounters with getting stuck
                            on a quadrant, convinced I knew the answer, and facing this challenge across multiple
                            sports. In developing this site, I aimed to preserve the essence of the original game,
                            choosing not to offer direct answers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, I opted for a more subtle approach,
                            incorporating hints to assist fellow grid enthusiasts in cracking the quiz. This decision
                            stems from a desire to recognize and reward the existing knowledge that players bring to the
                            game, keeping the spirit of the challenge intact while fostering an environment of
                            camaraderie among sports aficionados.

                            Basketball Reference is the go-to place for all the stats we use on this site to give you
                            details about players who meet the criteria and the info needed for the hints. The
                            ImmaculateGrid website also relies on Basketball Reference for its player database. Beyond
                            that, Basketball Reference holds the reputation as the top spot for basketball statistics.
                            Not only that, but it also extends its excellence to sister sites covering other sports
                            featured on the ImmaculateGrid website, such as American football, soccer, and baseball.
                            This makes Basketball Reference a comprehensive resource hub for sports enthusiasts seeking
                            detailed and reliable information across a range of sports categories.

                            The NBA is the premier basketball league in the world. It hosts many of the best players,
                            and is a commercial juggerenaut. All the previous sites mentioned are based on the NBA and
                            its players. The NBA is the source of all the information on this site, either directly or
                            indirectly.

                            This website sources all of its images from the NBA website. These are the most reliable,
                            up-to-date sources for images and contain the most standardized images for each player.
                            Calling the images from the NBA website also allows for the images to be displayed in a
                            consistent manner, as opposed to images from other sources that may be of different sizes
                            and resolutions.
